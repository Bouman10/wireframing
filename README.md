# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide that outlines the structure and layout of a web page or app. It’s like a blueprint — showing where elements like buttons, text, images, and navigation will go before any real design or code begins.

## Why Wireframing Matters in the Design Process

Wireframes play a key role in the early stages of product development. Here’s why:

- 🧠 They help clarify your ideas visually.
- 📐 They guide layout decisions without being distracted by colors or images.
- 👥 They make collaboration easier — clients, designers, and developers can all give feedback early.
- 🛠️ They help catch problems before investing time in design or code.
- 📋 They define user flow and functionality clearly.

Wireframes are low-fidelity and quick to create, making them ideal for experimentation, feedback, and iteration.
